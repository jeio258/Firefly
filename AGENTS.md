# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Firefly is an Astro 7 site with Svelte islands and TypeScript configuration. Main source code lives in `src/`: routes in `src/pages`, layouts in `src/layouts`, reusable UI in `src/components`, styles in `src/styles`, content in `src/content`, helpers in `src/utils`, and Markdown/HTML plugins in `src/plugins`. Site configuration is split across `src/config` with matching type definitions in `src/types`; prefer imports from `@/config` when available. Static files served directly belong in `public`, source-managed images in `src/assets`, docs in `docs` and `Firefly-Docs`, and automation in `scripts`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use `pnpm`; the `preinstall` script enforces it.

- `pnpm dev` or `pnpm start`: run the local Astro dev server.
- `pnpm check`: run Astro diagnostics.
- `pnpm type-check`: run TypeScript with `--noEmit`.
- `pnpm format`: format `src` with Biome.
- `pnpm lint`: run Biome checks and safe fixes on `src`.
- `pnpm build`: generate icons, LQIPs, the Astro build, font subsets, and Pagefind search output in `dist`.
- `pnpm preview`: preview the production build locally.
- `pnpm new-post`: scaffold a new content post.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Biome is the formatter and linter. It uses tabs for indentation and double quotes for JavaScript/TypeScript strings. Keep Astro and Svelte components in `PascalCase` (`PostCard.astro`, `Search.svelte`), config modules in `camelCase` ending with `Config.ts`, and utilities in descriptive kebab case such as `date-utils.ts`. Keep `src/types` aligned with `src/config`. Avoid unrelated formatting churn.

## Testing Guidelines

There is no dedicated unit-test framework configured. Before submitting changes, run `pnpm check`, `pnpm type-check`, and `pnpm build` for rendering, content, or generated asset work. For visual or interactive changes, verify with `pnpm dev` or `pnpm preview` and include screenshots in the PR. Name future tests near the feature they cover, using the local file name as the stem.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use Conventional Commits, matching the current history: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, and `chore: ...`. Keep commits and PRs focused on one concern. PRs should include a concise summary, linked issues when relevant, validation commands run, and screenshots for UI changes. Discuss major features or design changes in an issue or discussion before implementation.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit secrets, tokens, or service keys in config files. Keep deployment-specific settings in the target platform environment, and review generated files such as `dist`, `src/constants/lqips.json`, and `src/constants/icons.ts` before committing them.

## Scroll Performance Constraints

Scroll-linked work in `src/utils/` is rAF-throttled and must stay cheap on mobile — do not regress these (archived from the removed `CLAUDE.md`):

- `fullscreen-wallpaper-utils.ts` — fullscreen-mode title fade + blur ramp. The blur value `--fullscreen-blur` is **quantized to 2px steps** (skips writes when unchanged) and the max blur (`--overlay-blur`) is **cached** (read once; refreshed by a MutationObserver on `#wallpaper-wrapper` style). Avoid per-frame `getComputedStyle` or continuous full-screen `filter: blur()` writes — each change re-rasterizes the whole viewport on mobile.
- `grid-layout-utils.ts` — `updateSidebarStickySpacing()` is the per-scroll path and **must not read layout** (`offsetHeight` etc.). The sidebar top-container visibility (`hasVisibleTop`) is cached by `refreshSidebarStickyState()`, which runs on init/navigation only.
- Fullscreen blur ramp can be disabled per device via `backgroundWallpaper.fullscreen.blurRamp.enable.{desktop,mobile}` — when off, fullscreen mode has no blur on that device (home + other pages) and the settings-panel blur slider is hidden.
